# Data Science Portfolio

This repository containing my portfolio of data science projects for self learning and improve my skills with Data Science and Machine Learning.

## Projects

- [Real or Not Real? NLP with Disasters Tweets](https://github.com/saorinsandro/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Real_or_Not_NLP_with_Disaster_Tweets.ipynb): A model to predict which Tweets mention real disasters using Natural Language Processing and some ML Models.<br />
  <br />**Highlights from this project:**
  <br />- Preprocessing tweets data with text preprocessing pipeline using some NLTK tools;
  <br />- Transforming the data with TfIdfVectorizer;
  <br />- Visualizing the word distribution with PCA and t-SNE;
  <br />- Testing a list of models and choose a best model using ROC-AUC curve;
  <br />- Choosing the best threshold that improves the model results based on preferred metrics.<br />
  <br />*Tools: NLTK, TfidfVectorizer, SKLearn;*<br /><br />
