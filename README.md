# Data Science Portfolio

This repository containing my portfolio of data science projects for self learning and improve my skills with Data Science and Machine Learning.

## Projects

- Real or Not Real? NLP with Disasters Tweets: A model to predict which Tweets mention real disasters using Natural Language Processing and some ML Models.<br />
  <br />**Highlights from this project:**
  <br />- Preprocessing tweets data with text preprocessing pipeline using some NLTK tools;
  <br />- Transforming the data with TFIDFVectorizer;
  <br />- Visualizing the word distribution with PCA and t-SNE;
  <br />- Testing a list of models and choose a best model using ROC-AUC curve;
  <br />- Choosing the best threshold that improves the model results based on preferred metrics.<br />
  <br />*Tools: NLTK, TfidfVectorizer, SKLearn;*<br /><br />
